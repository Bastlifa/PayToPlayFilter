This is my first extension for chrome. Maybe it works, maybe not. It seems fine to me, but there could be something horribly wrong with it :)

What it does: on Roll20's LFG forum, it filters out posts which say "paid" in the title. That's it. Well, specifically, it removes those posts from the document on your browser. Read the code, it's very short.

To use, which, no warranty, I can't recommend this, etc, you want the icon.png, manifest.json, and siteFilter.js, (and maybe the background.js, though it's empty). Put them in a folder, go to chrome://extensions, turn on developer mode, and load unpacked. select the folder, and you should be good to go.

I don't expect anyone to use this, but it's kind of nice for not having to check every post to see if it's a paid game. Clears up the clutter.
